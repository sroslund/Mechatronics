 *
 * Template file to set up a Heirarchical State Machine to work with the Events and
 * Services Framework (ES_Framework) on the Uno32 for the CMPE-118/L class. Note that 
 * this file will need to be modified to fit your exact needs, and most of the names
 * will have to be changed to match your code.
 *
 * There is another template file for the SubHSM's that is slightly differet, and
 * should be used for all of the subordinate state machines (flat or heirarchical)
 *
 * This is provided as an example and a good place to start.

 * @Function RunTemplateHSM(ES_Event ThisEvent)

 * @return Event - return event (type and param), in general should be ES_NO_EVENT
 * @brief This function is where you implement the whole of the heirarchical state
 *        machine, as this is called any time a new event is passed to the event
 *        queue. This function will be called recursively to implement the correct
 *        order for a state transition to be: exit current state -> enter next state
 *        using the ES_EXIT and ES_ENTRY events.
 * @note Remember to rename to something appropriate.
 *       The lower level state machines are run first, to see if the event is dealt
 *       with there rather than at the current level. ES_EXIT and ES_ENTRY events are
 *       not consumed as these need to pass pack to the higher level state machine.
